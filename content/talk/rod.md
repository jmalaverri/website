# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "In recent years, we have witnessed the emergence of open (DBpedia, Wikidata, and YAGO) and industrial (Google and Diffbot) Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which store a huge volume of linked crossdomain data. Many of these KGs, such as DBPedia and Yago, are mainly created from information automatically extracted from Wikipedia based on data contained in the list of infoboxes, category structures, geo-coordinates, etc. However, information from crowdsourcing as in the case of Wikipedia, is not always error free, ambiguity, biased data, and may not adequately reflect change over time. In spite of these issues, these KGs have been used as reliable information sources for different purposes, such as for annotating mentions of DBpedia resources in text (DBpedia Spotlight), allowing semantic full-text search (Broccoli), enhancing google's search engine results, and so on. Taking this scenario into account, our work aims at building an approach to assess the veracity of a knowledge base based on spatio-temporal information. Because Yago links a temporal and a spatial dimension to many of its facts and entities, we have exploited it to infer spatio-temporal facts that should serve as a basis for our approach. Later, we can gather different information from several KGs, to apply our approach, and check their accuracy against one another."
