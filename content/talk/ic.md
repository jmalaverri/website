abstract = "Modern science practices rely heavily in accessing a huge volume of data from a variety of sources, with different formats and related to a diversity of topics. Such data need to be analyzed and managed under many contexts, being provided by many groups, each with their own models, vocabularies, methods, and perspectives of the world. Scientific workflow systems have been adopted as a part of the infrastructure that allows the coordination of multi-step, distributed data processing, in particular when involving many scientific groups. However, it is necessary to allow researchers to verify whether their data, processes and experiments outcomes meet the required quality criteria. Data quality is a topic that has pervaded computer science research for decades. Though there are many proposals for data quality assessment, there are still open problems such as mechanisms to support flexible quality assessment and ways to derive data quality. In this talk, we present our work towards the development of a workflow-based computational framework to help scientists in the assessment of quality of their experiments."
