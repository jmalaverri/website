I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Computer Research Laboratory ([LRI)](<https://www.lri.fr/>) at [University Paris Sud](<http://www.u-psud.fr/fr/index.html>) and also a member of the [LaHDAK](<https://www.lri.fr/equipe.php?eq=30>) group. Former member of [LIS](<http://www.lis.ic.unicamp.br/>) Lab at [IC-Unicamp](<http://www.ic.unicamp.br>), under the mentorship of Prof. Claudia Bauzer Medeiros. My research interests include, but are not limited to, scientific data management, data quality analysis, and software development. Nowadays, I am currently working on the development of a solution to assess the veracity of Knowledge Bases based on spatio-temporal context.
