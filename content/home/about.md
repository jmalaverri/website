I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Computing of the University of Campinas ([IC-Unicamp)](<http://www.ic.unicamp.br>), Brazil and also a member of the [LIS](<http://www.lis.ic.unicamp.br/>) Lab. My research is focused on, but are not limited to, the development of computational mechanisms to enable the assessment of quality aiming at supporting reproducibility in science.
