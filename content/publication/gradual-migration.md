abstract = "This paper presents the preliminary effort at CPqD for transitioning part of its legacy software system to a cloud-enabled environment. We review the major strategies for cloud migration and propose a roadmap with four steps for gradual migration of legacy systems to a cloud environment. CPqD myNet, a subset of CPqD's broader Operation Support System (OSS) software, is described as CPqD's early efforts to develop a reliable SaaS-based telco system. We also describe our current efforts to migrate CPqD's OSS software functionalities towards PaaS technology. The paper closes with a discussion on the proposed roadmap, comments about its dependability and indications for future work."
